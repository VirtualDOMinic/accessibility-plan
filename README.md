# accessibility-plan
Planning for my idea for a site to improve accessibility by providing stories and resources for people who those who have hurdles to overcome


## Ideas for project name
- You can code (youCanCode/ucancode)
- ...none others yet

## Overview
- Aim to allay fears of (and provide practical resources for) people who may be hesitant to try coding due to negative stereotypes and/or worries they have about how their experience may be (e.g. sexism, racism) as a dev
- "Database" of resources (links to communities, courses, stories...) for people listed in the "filtering options" section below
- Allow people to filter for any/all of the factors putting them off and see a "curated", nicely-formatted list of resources

## Considerations
- Needs to be accessible
- Quite a big scope
- Think about filtering categories, as some may be too broad
- Need to make it clear early on that it's in alpha! Don't want people getting discouraged if they don't see (m)any resources come up for them
- Ensure no accidental use of terms/titles that may be deemed offensive
- Encourage (and actively seek out) contributions from a broad range of people

## MVP
- Host on GitHub pages? This would mean no back-end for now
- Layout/CSS
- Functioning filtering system
- Enough content to be useful for at least some groups
- Submission system?

## Beyond MVP
- Hosted externally with proper back-end
- Database and submission system (allow visitors to suggest links/resources or share their own)
- Cached versions of resources to ensure they're always viewable/mitigate issue of link rot
- More granular filtering

## Filtering options, AKA factors that might be discouraging people from coding
### Access
- Language: courses/resources covering a range of languages, English learning resources (if appropriate), stories from successful devs
- Location: online resources (e.g. MOOCs) that can be accessed by those based somewhere with few local learning resources. Quite a complex one if we go beyond (e.g. to internet access, travel, visas, etc.)
- Money: similar to above points, but also links to resources/charities that offer free help or even funding?

### Gender & sexuality
- Women: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for women
- Trans/non-binary: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for trans people
- LGB(T)Q+: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for LGBQ+ people

### Disability/mental health
- Mental health: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those with mental health disorders/concerns (quite broad)
- Social: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those with social anxiety, autism spectrum disorders...
- Learning disabilities: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those with learning disabilities (e.g. dyslexia)
- Physical disabilities: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those with physical disabilities

### Race
- Ethnic minorities: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for people of colour. More granularity would be useful here. 

### Other
- Age (young): sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those who think they're too young to learn/get involved
- Age (old): sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those who think that it's too late to learn
- "Bad at X" (e.g. "bad at maths"): sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those who think they're not "wired" like a programmer
- Education: sites/resources, success stories & meetups for those who did an unrelated degree, have no degree, dropped out of school, or have spent a long time away from (formal) education
